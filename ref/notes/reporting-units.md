# Reporting unit selection

## Reporting units in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reporting and why MTC02E is used in these repositories

In compiling these graphics and charts (in this and other repositories), I've used *millions* of tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents (MTCO2E). 

This was done for reasons of practicality (to enable the comparison of emissions reports between industries). But it is far from a desirable yardstick. 

MTCO2E is the *de facto* standard in emissions-heavy industries like oil and gas because, in part, it is such a large unit. 

It enables denoting emissions as "517 MTCO2E" which looks less shocking, to the naked eye, than stating that the emissions were 517,000,000 **tonnes* of co2 equivalents. To be less cynical, using this unit also makes pragmatici sense as it avoids having to constantly fill up tables with zeroes.  

An unhelpful fact about MTCO2E is that it is easy to mistake for *metric* tonnes of CO2 equivalents which, of course, has the same acronym. A further complication: reporting is sometimes denominated in MMTCO2E (millions of metric tonnes of CO2E). 
And finally: a tonne (also metric tonne) is a straightforward unit of 1,000KG but a menacing "false friend" exists in the "short ton". The standardisation on the former, at least, has to be appreciated.

Of course, if you don't have the average emissions of an oil and gas major - let's say you're a small, sustainability-conscious tech company who happens to be committed to GHG emissions reporting - it makes no sense to choose MTCO2E as your reporting unit. 

If you've calculated your emissions to be (just) 100 tonnes of CO2e (tCO2e) then that's 0.0001 MTCO2E.To make matters worse, there's also kgCO2e (common in "medium scale" reporting) and gigatonnes.

As the purpose of this analysis is to compare the profitability of large companies (using EBITDA as a measure) and their sustainability performance (using GHG emissions as a surrogate), I thought it made sense to standardise the units on two "large" units: *millions* of tonnes of CO2e and billions of dollars respectively. We hope for the day when the former unit, at least, will no longer be necessary!
